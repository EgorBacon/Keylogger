# Keylogger
This is a key logger in python, really basic but still works

The library has been acting up, but should work. if not just google errors

Usage:
Run python3 pyxhook.py
then python3 key-log.py which starts the key logging, each key recorded as a new line
"`" to stop the program

Common problems:
 The path, and library.
